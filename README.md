# ai-agent-project
This project is an AI agent that reads data from a CSV file or Google Sheet, performs web searches for specific information based on a user-defined query, and leverages a language model (LLM) to extract structured information. The extracted data is displayed in a Streamlit dashboard and can be downloaded as a CSV or uploaded back to a Google Sheet.
